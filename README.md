# logreg_algorithim

I implemented logistic regression from scratch using no auto diff ect. The only thing I used was Eigen::MatrixXd objects. I want to make not that I really improved my calculus skills relative to machine learning in this project. 

I designed the algorithim in such a way that the model stops training once 91% accuracy is reached.
